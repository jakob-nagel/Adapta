# Adapta - An Advanced Audio Player with Tempo Adjustment

I have created Adapta as part of my master thesis. A description and
documentation of Adapta can be found in the thesis.

The current version of the code is 0.9.0 and is missing parts of the online beat
detection feature as well as a complete documentation of the code.
